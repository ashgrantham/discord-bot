# discord-bot

**Version 1.0:**
a simple discord bot!
***note this is not how you invite a discord bot to your server, it is the source code on basically making your own bot*,**
**the prefix is '!'**, for example !clear or !kick,
**this bot was origionally designed for my server **so you will have to edit in the commands some of the role id's to match your servers,
some features will **break** in the future,
some features **require** admin roles,
the bot **requires** admin roles,
the bot **needs** to be a higher role than what it is targeting for most cases,
you will **need **to change the token to match your own bot,
you **need** a bot from discord.com/developer
commands list:
ban,
kick,
clear,
creator,
canikick,
ping,
secretrole,


The token uploaded in the files is now invalid so good luck stealing it lol,
you will need to install node_modules in the folder,

*Note everyone can use every admin command*,

**Version 1.1:**
***you will need to install the ms module for this, aswell as creating a member and muted role, also remove all perms from the @everyone role*,**
Added mute and unmute commmands (!mute, !unmute),
if you type !mute @whoyouwant to mute it mutes them indefenetly,
or you could type !mute @whoyouwant 1m for 1 minute or 1s for 1 second or 1h for 1 hour or 1d for 1 day or 1 for 1 ms etc.

**Version 1.2:**
added join role and message,
*make sure to enable all intent gateway things in the developer portal*,
this is probably all im going to do for today,
